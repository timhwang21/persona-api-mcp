# Prompt

Build an MCP server that:
- Integrates with Persona's REST API
- Works locally in development
- Optimized for usage with Claude Code
- Exposes every endpoint as a tool (e.g. inquiry create, inquiry show, account redact)
- Exposes API responses as resources
- Exposes prompts for every Persona model (e.g. inquiry, verification, account, report)

## TODO
- First, think deeply about the task. Then, come up with an implementation plan. Save this to a local file.
- Next, start implementing the Inquiry endpoint found at ../persona-web/openapi/external/paths/inquiries, and then pause and ask me to review the work. Document code extensively.
- Finally, provide setup instructions (e.g. what API keys or credentials need to be provided for proper functionality)
- Use the MCP inspector (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to debug any issues

## Resources

- The OpenAPI spec and all documentation for the Persona REST API can be found at ../persona-web/openapi
- Implementation for all REST API endpoints can be found at ../persona-web/app/controllers/api/external
- An overview of how MCP works can be found at ./llms-full.txt
- The MCP TypeScript SDK codebase and doucmentation can be found at ./typescript-sdk

running npm start gives an error. fix the error and run `npm start` to confirm issues are fixed.

the initial error is "Error: Configuration validation failed: persona.apiKey: Persona API key is required". however, the app should be configured to read from .env. .env is present and contains an API key. fix this.

repeat this fixing process in a loop until `npm start` works without error.

I don't want to have a real openapi file that's copied from persona-web. remove this and create a proper symbolic link.

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]the error "too many levels of symbolic links" seems to be happening due to an issue in the persona-web directory. I've fixed it. the correct path is /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-web/openapi/external/openapi.yaml. now fix the symlink. ensure the project builds.

convert the openapi symlink to a relative symlink. assume that the persona-web directory is always adjacent to the current directory.

I am getting the following output when starting claude in debug mode in the persona-web directory:

my ~/.claude.json configures the persona-api mcp server on line 491.

identify the problem and tell me how to fixi t.

why is env needed when I have a .env file in the persona-api-mcp directory?

I confirmed the issue is that the env variables are not being read. running node /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/dist/server/index.js from persona-api-mcp works but running it from persona-web does not, even with cwd.

explain why this is happening and how this can be fixed.

why is there ../../ before .env

I am getting the following issues. Help me fix them.

I gave the prompt 'Fetch all inquiries using the persona-api MCP server. Then, use the inquiry_analysis prompt to analyze the last inquiry.'. This triggered usage of a tool ` persona-api:inquirie_list`. Why is it named `inquirie_list` instead of `inquiries_list`?

This tool is erroring with ` Error: MCP error -32603: Cannot destructure property 'name' of 'request.params' as it is undefined.`. Fix it.

Next, add vitest to this repo and add tests for everything. specifically ensure you add a test for the MCP error above.

audit every usage of any and see if a better type can be used. avoid any wherever possible.

because we are using vitest now, ensure all references to jest are removed, and that the vitest tests work

append all my prompts AS IS with no edits to prompt.md

ensure all specs are passing

# User Prompts from Session

## Prompt 1
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me carefully analyze the conversation chronologically to capture all user requests, technical details, and my actions:

1. **Initial User Request**: The user asked me to implement support for ALL other endpoints described in the openapi/ directory, including accounts, cases, transactions, verifications, reports, cases, and devices, following inquiry patterns with proper spec coverage and ensuring tests pass.

2. **My Initial Approach**: I started by exploring the codebase and understanding the existing inquiry tool implementation patterns. I found a sophisticated dual approach combining manually-crafted tools with auto-generated tools from OpenAPI specs.

3. **Critical User Feedback**: The user interrupted me with strong feedback: "this is entirely wrong. STOP creating files using Zod. follow the examples of /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/tools/inquiry/generated.ts" and provided specific instructions:
   - Remove all inquiry tools that are not autogenerated
   - Fix naming from /inquiry/ to /inquiries/
   - Remove all tools I created
   - Update src/api/types.ts to derive from YAML, not manual definitions
   - Make src/api/client.ts parameterized instead of redundant
   - Implement tools following YAML-only pattern
   - IMPORTANT: DO NOT REDEFINE ANY TYPES, VALIDATIONS, ETC. RELY ON THE YAML!

4. **Course Correction**: I completely changed approach to follow YAML-first philosophy, removing all manual Zod-based tools and implementing universal tool generation.

5. **AGENTS.md Update**: User requested updating AGENTS.md to emphasize YAML reliance as core philosophy.

6. **Final Implementation Fixes**: User provided specific fixes:
   - Remove all legacy methods
   - Update knownTags to read from YAML file with extraction script
   - Generate types from OpenAPI specs instead of using 'any'
   - Add package.json commands and ensure they run before build
   - Ensure tests and typechecks pass

7. **Current State**: I was in the middle of implementing these final fixes, having just removed legacy methods from the API client when the user requested this summary.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to implement support for ALL other endpoints described in the openapi/ directory (accounts, cases, transactions, verifications, reports, devices) following inquiry patterns with proper spec coverage. However, the user provided critical course correction emphasizing a YAML-FIRST philosophy where the OpenAPI specification serves as the single source of truth. The user explicitly requested: remove manually created tools, fix directory naming (/inquiry/ to /inquiries/), update API client to be parameterized, derive types from YAML instead of manual definitions, and implement all tools using YAML-based generation pattern. Finally, the user requested specific implementation fixes including removing legacy methods, auto-generating tags and types from YAML files, and adding package.json scripts.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - YAML-FIRST development philosophy
   - OpenAPI specification as single source of truth
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture
   - Dynamic tool generation from OpenAPI specs
   - Tool Factory pattern for auto-generating MCP tools
   - Parameterized API client design
   - TypeScript type generation from OpenAPI schemas
   - Zod schema validation (explicitly rejected by user)
   - Dual architecture (manual vs generated tools)
   - Resource caching and management
   - Security validation patterns
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Axios HTTP client with interceptors

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - `/Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/tools/inquiry/generated.ts`
     - Critical reference file showing the correct YAML-based pattern
     - Contains tool factory usage: `toolFactory.generateToolsForTag('Inquiries')`
     - Shows proper tool initialization and execution patterns

   - `/Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/tools/generated/all-tools.ts`
     - Created universal tool generator for ALL endpoints
     - Current knownTags implementation that needs to be replaced:
     ```typescript
     const knownTags = [
       'Inquiries', 'Accounts', 'Cases', 'Verifications', 'Reports',
       'Transactions', 'Devices', 'API Keys', 'Webhooks', 'Events',
       // ... more tags
     ];
     ```

   - `/Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/api/client.ts`
     - Refactored from redundant resource-specific methods to parameterized design
     - Core generic methods: `get`, `post`, `patch`, `put`, `delete`
     - Removed all legacy methods (lines 359-425) per user request
     - Generic makeRequest method:
     ```typescript
     async makeRequest<T = any>(config: {
       method: HTTPMethod;
       url: string;
       data?: any;
       params?: QueryParams;
       headers?: Record<string, string>;
       timeout?: number;
     }): Promise<T>
     ```

   - `/Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/api/types.ts`
     - Removed manual type definitions per user feedback
     - Placeholder getTypeDefinitions function that needs implementation
     - Legacy compatibility types marked for replacement

   - `/Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/AGENTS.md`
     - Completely rewritten to emphasize YAML-FIRST philosophy
     - Documents anti-patterns to avoid (manual Zod schemas, hardcoded endpoints)
     - Establishes "If it's not in the OpenAPI YAML, it shouldn't exist in the code" principle

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **TypeScript compilation errors**: Fixed multiple issues with axios types, optional parameters, and PersonaAPIError constructor parameters
   - **Logger.error signature mismatch**: Fixed by passing Error object as second parameter
   - **Exact optional property types**: Fixed by conditionally setting properties instead of passing undefined values
   - **User rejection of Zod approach**: Completely removed all manually created Zod-based tools and switched to YAML-only generation
   - **Directory naming**: Fixed /inquiry/ to /inquiries/ as requested
   - **Redundant API methods**: Replaced with parameterized generic methods

5. Problem Solving:
   Solved the core architectural challenge of moving from manual tool definitions to YAML-first generation. Implemented universal tool generation supporting all OpenAPI endpoints. Fixed TypeScript compilation issues while maintaining type safety. Successfully removed all manual type definitions and redundant code patterns.

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request: "based on the implementation of inquiry tools in this repo, implement support for ALL other endpoints described in the openapi/ directory..."
   - Critical feedback: "this is entirely wrong. STOP creating files using Zod. follow the examples of /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/tools/inquiry/generated.ts"
   - AGENTS.md request: "update AGENTS.md to emphasize YAML reliance as a core philosophy of this project"
   - Final fixes request: "implement the following fixes - Remove all methods marked as legacy... update src/tools/generated/all-tools.ts:29 knownTags to instead read from a YAML file..."
   - Summary request: "Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far..."

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Create script to extract tags from OpenAPI specs and generate YAML file
   - Update all-tools.ts to read tags from generated YAML file instead of hardcoded array
   - Create script to generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI specs
   - Replace all 'any' types with auto-generated types
   - Add package.json commands for tag extraction and type generation
   - Update build command to run extraction scripts before compilation
   - Ensure all tests and typechecks pass with new implementation

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of implementing the user's final fixes. Specifically, I had just completed removing all legacy methods from `/Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/api/client.ts` (lines 359-425 containing methods like listInquiries, createInquiry, etc.). The next immediate tasks are to create the OpenAPI tag extraction script and type generation script as requested.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's explicit request: "update src/tools/generated/all-tools.ts:29 knownTags to instead read from a YAML file. this YAML file should be derived from the openapi specs. Add a script to extract the tags from the openapi specs."

   The next step should be creating a script to extract tags from the OpenAPI specifications. This script should:
   - Parse the OpenAPI YAML files in the openapi/ directory
   - Extract all unique tags from the operations
   - Generate a YAML file containing the tag list
   - Be callable via a package.json script that runs before build

   Direct quote from user request: "Add a script to extract the tags from the openapi specs. add a command to package.json to call this script. ensure this command is called before the `build` command.".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

## Prompt 2
reflect on the last two prompts. update AGENTS.md with instructions to avoid making these errors again.

## Prompt 3
output all my prompts in this session to new-prompts.md

## Prompt 4
src/tools/generators/tool-factory.ts:624 looks incorrect. It hardcodes the string '/inquiries'. this won't work for other endpoints. how can this be fixed?

## Prompt 5
many other implementations in this file hardcode 'inquiry' or 'inquiries'. also check if these can be improved.
