# Development History

## Original Project Requirements

Build an MCP server that:
- Integrates with Persona's REST API
- Works locally in development  
- Optimized for usage with Claude Code
- Exposes every endpoint as a tool (e.g. inquiry create, inquiry show, account redact)
- Exposes API responses as resources
- Exposes prompts for every Persona model (e.g. inquiry, verification, account, report)

## Architecture Decisions

- **YAML-first approach**: Auto-generate tools from OpenAPI specifications rather than manual coding
- **Symlinked OpenAPI**: Link to persona-web/openapi instead of duplicating schemas
- **Type safety**: Use Zod for runtime validation alongside TypeScript
- **Defensive coding**: Extensive input validation and error handling

## Historical Notes

- Initial one-shot generation created substantial functionality but required refinement
- Switched from Zod schemas to OpenAPI YAML parsing for better maintainability
- Multiple iterations were needed to resolve TypeScript compilation errors
- Tool generation evolved from manual definitions to fully automated OpenAPI parsing

## Development Timeline

The project evolved through several key phases:

1. **Initial Setup**: Configuration and environment issues resolved
2. **OpenAPI Integration**: Symbolic linking implementation for dynamic spec loading  
3. **Tool Generation**: Automated tool creation from OpenAPI specifications
4. **Claude Code Integration**: MCP protocol compliance and connection debugging
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error recovery implementation
6. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and efficiency improvements

## Key Milestones

- **YAML-First Philosophy**: Shifted from manual Zod schemas to OpenAPI-driven generation
- **Universal Tool Factory**: Implemented dynamic tool creation for all API endpoints
- **Test Suite**: Added comprehensive Vitest testing with security focus
- **Type Safety**: Automated TypeScript type generation from OpenAPI specifications
- **Architecture Refinement**: Evolved from dual manual/generated approach to pure YAML-driven system
