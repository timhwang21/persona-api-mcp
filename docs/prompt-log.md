# Prompt

This is a log of the initial prompts I used for this project. After a certain point tracking these got too laborious so I stopped.

-----

Build an MCP server that:
- Integrates with Persona's REST API
- Works locally in development
- Optimized for usage with Claude Code
- Exposes every endpoint as a tool (e.g. inquiry create, inquiry show, account redact)
- Exposes API responses as resources
- Exposes prompts for every Persona model (e.g. inquiry, verification, account, report)

## TODO
- First, think deeply about the task. Then, come up with an implementation plan. Save this to a local file.
- Next, start implementing the Inquiry endpoint found at ../persona-web/openapi/external/paths/inquiries, and then pause and ask me to review the work. Document code extensively.
- Finally, provide setup instructions (e.g. what API keys or credentials need to be provided for proper functionality)
- Use the MCP inspector (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to debug any issues

## Resources

- The OpenAPI spec and all documentation for the Persona REST API can be found at ../persona-web/openapi
- Implementation for all REST API endpoints can be found at ../persona-web/app/controllers/api/external
- An overview of how MCP works can be found at ./llms-full.txt
- The MCP TypeScript SDK codebase and doucmentation can be found at ./typescript-sdk

running npm start gives an error. fix the error and run `npm start` to confirm issues are fixed.

the initial error is "Error: Configuration validation failed: persona.apiKey: Persona API key is required". however, the app should be configured to read from .env. .env is present and contains an API key. fix this.

repeat this fixing process in a loop until `npm start` works without error.

I don't want to have a real openapi file that's copied from persona-web. remove this and create a proper symbolic link.

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]the error "too many levels of symbolic links" seems to be happening due to an issue in the persona-web directory. I've fixed it. the correct path is /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-web/openapi/external/openapi.yaml. now fix the symlink. ensure the project builds.

convert the openapi symlink to a relative symlink. assume that the persona-web directory is always adjacent to the current directory.

I am getting the following output when starting claude in debug mode in the persona-web directory:

[DEBUG] MCP server "persona-api": Connection failed: McpError: MCP error -32000: Connection closed

my ~/.claude.json configures the persona-api mcp server on line 491.

identify the problem and tell me how to fixi t.

why is env needed when I have a .env file in the persona-api-mcp directory?

I confirmed the issue is that the env variables are not being read. running node /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/dist/server/index.js from persona-api-mcp works but running it from persona-web does not, even with cwd.

explain why this is happening and how this can be fixed.

why is there ../../ before .env

I am getting the following issues. Help me fix them.

I gave the prompt 'Fetch all inquiries using the persona-api MCP server. Then, use the inquiry_analysis prompt to analyze the last inquiry.'. This triggered usage of a tool ` persona-api:inquirie_list`. Why is it named `inquirie_list` instead of `inquiries_list`?

This tool is erroring with ` Error: MCP error -32603: Cannot destructure property 'name' of 'request.params' as it is undefined.`. Fix it.

Next, add vitest to this repo and add tests for everything. specifically ensure you add a test for the MCP error above.

audit every usage of any and see if a better type can be used. avoid any wherever possible.

because we are using vitest now, ensure all references to jest are removed, and that the vitest tests work

append all my prompts AS IS with no edits to prompt.md

ensure all specs are passing

this is entirely wrong. STOP creating files using Zod. follow the examples of /Users/timhwang/Development/persona-api-mcp/src/tools/inquiry/generated.ts" and provided specific instructions:
   - Remove all inquiry tools that are not autogenerated
   - Fix naming from /inquiry/ to /inquiries/
   - Remove all tools I created
   - Update src/api/types.ts to derive from YAML, not manual definitions
   - Make src/api/client.ts parameterized instead of redundant
   - Implement tools following YAML-only pattern
   - IMPORTANT: DO NOT REDEFINE ANY TYPES, VALIDATIONS, ETC. RELY ON THE YAML!

reflect on the last two prompts. update AGENTS.md with instructions to avoid making these errors again.

src/tools/generators/tool-factory.ts:624 looks incorrect. It hardcodes the string '/inquiries'. this won't work for other endpoints. how can this be fixed?

many other implementations in this file hardcode 'inquiry' or 'inquiries'. also check if these can be improved.
