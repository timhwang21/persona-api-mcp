# Notes written by a human

- The one-shot approach generated a lot of stuff. I have no idea if it works.
- PROMPT.md contains the initial prompt.
- I then asked it to symlink instead of duplicating everything via Zod: "the zod schema is nice but I don't like how it is implemented with Zod. Can you symlink ../persona-web/openapi/external and parse the YAML instead? Or use a tool for parsing openapi?" If stuff is broken it may be because of this big refactor.
- It had lots of code errors / type errors in the first pass.
